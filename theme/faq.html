				<h4>Why outsource the book-keeping tasks?</h4>
				<p>Starting a business is challenging and success may be easier achieved if the management focuses on the core business and
				outsource bookkeeping to a firm with Certified Public Accountants (CPA) who are knowledgeable of the latest accounting
				practices in the Philippines.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6 mt-4">
				<h4>Why can’t I do the book-keeping myself?</h4>
				<p>It may be more efficient, in terms of time and money, to outsource bookkeeping to a firm rendering professional
				services.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6 mt-4">
				<h4>How much time and money can I save if I outsource accounting/bookkeeping?</h4>
				<p>Simple bookkeeping would take at least 3-5 hours a day if performed by a CPA. This time may be better spent managing the
				operations of the business.</p>
				
				<p>Hiring an in-house CPA to perform accounting, tax compliance, and payroll tasks may cost more than the professional fee
				of a firm that can perform the same tasks. The firm would also have the contractual obligation to ensure continuity of
				services regardless of any changes in its manpower.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6 mt-4">
				<h4>What should small business owners look-out for?</h4>
				<p>The business should only commence operations after it obtains the necessary permits and licenses from the Securities and
				Exchange Commission (SEC) for corporations and partnerships or Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) for sole
				proprietorships, local government unit, and the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR).</p>
				
				<p>As soon as the BIR issues the Certificate of Registration, the taxpayer is required to start filing tax returns even if
				it has no transactions to report.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6 mt-4">
				<h4>How often do we need to submit these reports/requirements to the BIR?</h4>
				<p>In general, taxpayers are required to pay three main taxes, as follows:</p>
				<p> &nbsp &nbsp 1. Withholding Taxes – filed monthly and annually <br>
					&nbsp &nbsp 2. Income Tax – filed quarterly and annually <br>
					&nbsp &nbsp 3. Value Added Tax – filed monthly and quarterly</p>
				<p>The taxpayer may be required to file additional tax returns, as provided in its BIR Certificate of Registration.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6 mt-4">
				<h4>What are BIR/tax reports/requirements that we need to maintain/submit?</h4>
				<p>The taxpayer needs to regularly file tax returns relevant to the tax types indicated in its BIR Certificate of Registration.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6 mt-4">
				<h4>What happens if I already have a registered entity in the Philippines but I’m not yet operational, do I need to comply
				with BIR reports?</h4>
				<p>The taxpayer needs to start filing tax returns as soon as the BIR Certificate of Registration is issued. It may reflect
				in its returns that it has no transactions for the period.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6 mt-4">
				<h4>Are there any additional requirements for foreign businesses registered in the Philippines?</h4>
				<p>In general, there are no additional tax compliance requirements for foreign businesses. However, additional tax filings
				may be required for taxes that are unique to foreign entities such as branch profit remittance tax for profits remitted
				by a Philippine Branch to its Head Office.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-12 mt-4">
				<h4>What records must be maintained by businesses in the Philippines?</h4>
